let b = 0;
let a = 0

// Statements
// Group of words, numbers/operators that perform a task

a = b * 2;

// a, b => variables
// 2 => literal value
// =, *  => operators, perform actions such as assignment or mathematical operations
// a = b * 2 => Get the current value of b, multiply by 2, store in a

// Expressions
// Reference to a variable/value, or set of the same combined with operators

a = b * 2;

// 2 => lieteral value expression
// b => variable expression (get the value of b)
// b * 2 => arithmetic expression (do the multiplication by 2 on value from b)
// a = b * 2 => assignment expression (assign the result of b * 2 to a)

b * 2 // expression statement (more useful in call expression statement)

// Executing a program
